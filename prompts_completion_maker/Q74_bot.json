"Here are the 5 examples of prompts and completions in JSON format:\n\n```\n[\n  {\n    \"prompt\": \"Can I be a house-of-one at my level?\",\n    \"completion\": \"You must be at least a level 3 in any guild to become a house of one.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"prompt\": \"Is it possible for me to be a house-of-one?\",\n    \"completion\": \"In order to become a house of one, you need to be at least a level 3 member of any guild.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"prompt\": \"What level do I need to be to become a house-of-one?\",\n    \"completion\": \"To qualify as a house of one, you must attain at least a level 3 standing in any guild.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"prompt\": \"Can I join the house-of-one?\",\n    \"completion\": \"You need to have achieved level 3 membership in any guild to become a member of the house of one.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"prompt\": \"What are the requirements to join the house-of-one?\",\n    \"completion\": \"To join the house of one, you must be a level 3 member of any guild.\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\nPlease note that the JSON format is a collection of key-value pairs, where each key is a string value, and each value can be an object, an array or a simple scalar value. In this case, we have used objects with the keys \"prompt\" and \"completion\"."
