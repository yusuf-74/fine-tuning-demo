,2,Guild,What is the `Global max mid bill rate`?,"For every level, for every guild, and for every geography we define a range of hourly rates. For instance, a level 1 Engineer in EG should normally charge between $18 and $27 per hour, and will have a `Bill rate mid` of $23. This is the default number that gets loaded in flow.bld.ai when this person is added to a project. It is always possible for a PM to suggest a different rate, however, the minimum is the `Bill rate low` and there is no maximum. PMs will have conversations with clients to adjust rates for specific individuals, and (most of the time) this is significantly faster than inflation. The `Global max mid bill rate` is the maximum value that this middle range can take for an individual at that level across all guilds and geographies. This level of control allows us to very quickly and easily adjust everything globally in a way that it is globally fair, transparent, and efficient.""",bld.ai FAQ

In the US, we have been paying current (paid on the 28th for work period of the current month, 1st to the end of the month). Because of the parameters of comp engine, we will transition to within the 10th of the following month (work period 1st to the end of the previous month), dependent on each state's laws. When we move to paying for the previous month, this will be on a fixed date and we will have to do a transition payroll as needed to allow for people to plan.

,77,Houses / Recruitment,What does it mean that housemasters do not have direct control over workers in their house?,"Houses determine the gross total compensation and the expense account contributions of their workers. Workers can choose the exact percentage they wish to receive as vesting equity. 

On a given month, a worker may charge a client $8,000 USD, which would give their house $4,000.  In addition, the worker may have contributed to a proposal and recruiting, earning an extra $1,600 that month. Total house contribution by this worker: $6,600. 

The housemaster may have set the gross total compensation cost and the expense contribution of this worker to be $5,200 and $300 (office, travel, and cellphone plan) respectively. Total cost to the house  of that worker: $5,500 (leaving $1,100 for rainy days or other house expenses like training).

The worker may have decided to take 20% of this $5,200 as vesting equity, which would be 104 units (assuming $10/unit). In addition, the worker may have health insurance converate (e.g., $100), tax deductions (e.g., $320), bank fees (e.g., $40) and foreign exchange (assuming final amount is not in USD). Net, the worker may see in their bank account 5,200*(1-0.2)-(100+320+40) = $3,700.

If this hypothetical scenario happens after IPO, then the worker may also opt to sell 200 vested shares (that they would have previously accumulated at a cost of $2, or $400 in the past), adding an additional $2,000 compensation (less applicable capital gains taxes).",2022 06 16 all hands asia
,78,General,What is the bld.ai engine?,"The compensation engine is at the core of bld.ai innovation. Per vision document, it handles the following:
Maintains the canonical source of truth for all past and present workers and their associated
1. House 
2. Guild (level)
3. Recruits
4. Sales
5. Expense
6. Compensation (plan and actual)
7. Units of equity
8. Work logs
9. Skills
10. Clients and projects

The engine mainly processes 6 main inputs, discussed concisely below.",
,79,General,What are work logs?,"Work logs are the largest (in terms of quantity) input to the engine, they are inputted by the individual workers for the work they do for different clients. Each individual work log contains the following information:
The project this worklogs is billed against.
The worker who accomplished the task.
A description of the task accomplished.
The date of that work log.
How many hours were spent on the task.
The hourly rate of the worker in the project.

Worklogs are heavily audited, they are checked by the PM of the project, the QA team and then once again once we bill the client.
",
,80,General,What is the recruiter flow?,"This is where we keep data about the workers that bld.ai has as well as data about who were involved in the recruitment process for each worker.
For each worker, we store the following information:
Worker’s email address.
The hire date of the worker.
The house that recruited the worker.
Emails of the sourcers of the worker.
Emails of the interviewers of the worker.
Emails of the closers with the worker.
This is used later to calculate the commission of the recruiters.",
,81,General,What is the seller flow?,"This is where we keep data about the projects that bld.ai are currently involved in, this includes the different workers involved in closing the deal with the client.
For each project, we store the following information:
Project name.
Project’s start date
Emails of the project sourcers.
Emails of the project proposal writers.
Emails of the project closers.
This is used later to calculate the commission of the sellers.",
,82,General,What is the house in flow?,"House inflow is an input entered by the house masters for each of their respective house members to determine the compensation the worker should receive. 
The house master defines the following for each worker for each period (month):
The worker’s email.
The gross compensation of the worker.
How much of that compensation should go as cash to the worker.
How much should be added to the worker’s expenses credit card.
",
,83,General,What are the engine parameters?,"Engine parameters are responsible for determining how the revenue from each individual worklog is distributed.
As of 16th Jul 2022, the parameters are:

Worker, 50% =>  Percentage that the worker’s house gets from the worklog they submit.
Recruiter, 10% => Commission for the recruiters of the worker who submitted the worklog. The recruiter’s house gets this.
Seller, 10% => Commission for the sellers of the project that the worker submitted the worklogs for. The seller’s house gets this.
Overhead, 10% => This goes to cover the internal functions of the company (accounting, legal, etc…) as well as building software to be used by the company itself (ex. Flow)
Margin profit, 20% => Profit for the stakeholders of the company

",
,84,General,What are the actuals?,"Actuals are the gross cash numbers sent to each worker after the different components like taxes and benefits have been added. This is then used to calculate how much the worker was really paid in each period, which then determines how much equity the worker will get in bld.ai.
Actuals come from different sources by nature, since bld.ai is a global company, multiple payment methods are used depending on the country of the worker. These numbers are then aggregated in place to be uniform and easily referenceable.
