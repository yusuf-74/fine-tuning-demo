        "prompt": "How does a housemaster (whether house of one or house of many) do house expenses?",
        "completion": "Every Brex card has to be tied to an individual. Whether the housemaster spends on a laptop for themselves or pays for a big team dinner for his house, it is the same Brex card. The advantage of using an expense card is that these are before tax dollars. "

        "prompt": "What kind of expenses can a housemaster (whether house of one or house of many) use their Brex card for?",

This can include things like office supplies, team meals, software subscriptions, or even equipment like laptops or monitors. The only requirement is that each card is tied to an individual."

        "prompt": "Are there any limitations on what a housemaster (whether house of one or house of many) can spend their Brex card on?",
        "completion": "As long as an expense is related to the house, there are no limitations on what a housemaster can spend their Brex card on.

        "prompt": "Can a housemaster (whether house of one or house of many) use their Brex card for personal expenses?",
        "completion": "No, a housemaster cannot use their Brex card for personal expenses. Every Brex card must be tied to an individual, and expenses must be related to the house. However, this does mean that if a housemaster buys a laptop for themselves, it is still considered a house expense as long as it is being used for house-related activities."

    {
        "prompt": "Is there any advantage to using an expense card for house expenses?",
        "completion": "Yes, there is an advantage to using an expense card for house expenses. These are considered before-tax dollars, which means that they can help reduce the overall tax burden on the individual. Whether the housemaster is spending on a laptop for themselves or paying for a big team dinner for their house, it is the same Brex card that is used for all expenses."
