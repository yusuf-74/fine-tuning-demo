        "prompt": "How would the process of switching houses be affected by the comp engine?",
        "completion": "The comp engine could streamline the process of switching houses by providing a fair and consistent way to evaluate members' contributions and determine appropriate compensation. However, it would also depend on how each individual house chooses to use the engine and what criteria they prioritize in their decision-making process. Overall, the comp engine has the potential to simplify and improve the house-switching process, but it is ultimately up to each house to decide how to implement it."
