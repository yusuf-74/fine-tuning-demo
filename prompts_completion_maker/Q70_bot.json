"Sure, here is an example of prompts and completions in JSON format:\n\n```\n{\n    \"prompt\": \"For what reasons can someone get let go from bld.ai?\",\n    \"completions\": [\n        \"We will fire people for reasons like racism, sexism, fraud, bullying, cybersecurity breaches, etc.\",\n        \"If someone violates our code of conduct, they may be let go.\",\n        \"Insufficient work quality, missed deadlines, or failure to follow company policies could result in termination.\",\n        \"Any behavior that creates a hostile work environment will not be tolerated and may lead to dismissal.\",\n        \"If someone consistently fails to contribute value to our projects and team, they may be let go.\"\n    ]\n},\n``` \n\nNote: The above example provides prompt and five completions. You can add more examples if you need."
