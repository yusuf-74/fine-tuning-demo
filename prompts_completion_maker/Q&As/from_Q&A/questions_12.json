        "completion": "Full-time and part-time enrolment status for undergraduate students is calculated based on course enrolments and intentions, and the sum of the billing units by term. Generally, a one-term course is equal to one billing unit. You can confirm your billing units by term, and determine your enrolment status on MyServiceHub. Go to your Student Center, select Account Summary, and then Academic Information. The Units column confirms your billing units by term. Note that full-time status is calculated differently for determining eligibility for Full-time or Part-time OSAP.  Visit Student Financial Assistance for more information."
