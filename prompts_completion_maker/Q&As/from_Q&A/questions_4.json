        "prompt": "How can I transfer to another TMU program?",
        "completion": "Current and former TMU students can apply to transfer to another program using the online TMU Application. Before applying, check which programs are accepting applications, and be aware of the Application Dates and Guaranteed Dates for Consideration. Applications for the fall term must be received by February 1st for Grades-Plus programs and Grades-Only programs to be given equal consideration for admission. Students applying to a new program are required to meet the new program's admission requirements including the high school subject prerequisites and competitive averages and high academic standing in their current program. If you are concerned about not meeting the admission requirements, please contact the ServiceHub. If you are a CURRENT student in a TMU undergraduate program requesting a plan change within your program (e.g. BA English to BA Sociology or HR to Law and Business) you are not required to submit a TMU Application. Please consult your program department for appropriate application procedures. Students who are Required To Withdraw (RTW) will not be considered for transfer until their term of suspension is completed, unless the program considers Fresh Start Transfers. Please refer to the Required to Withdraw website for further details. Upon accepting an offer of admission into a new TMU program, you should confirm which of your completed TMU courses apply toward your new program. Visit the Internal TMU Course Transfers webpage for more information."
