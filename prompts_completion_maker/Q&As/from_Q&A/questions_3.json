        "completion": "Your T2202 (Tuition, Education & Textbook Amounts Certificate) is available for download on your MyServiceHub account usually during the third week in February (for the previous calendar year). To access your receipt, log into MyServiceHub  and click on the T2202 link on the left-hand side under the Student Fees section. There are two types of tax receipts available to students, the T2202 Tuition, Education & Textbook Amounts Certificate and the T4A Statement of Pension, Retirement, Annuity, and Other Income. T2202 is an official statement for income tax purposes of the tuition and fees paid for qualifying courses that are eligible for claim on the income tax return. T4A is an official statement for income tax purposes of scholarships, bursaries, awards or other income as defined by CRA that were provided by TMU to a student. If you were employed on campus, you will need to access your T4 through eHR, as it is not available through your MyServiceHub account. Questions should be directed toward Human Resources. More information is available on our Tax Receipts webpage. If you worked on campus, your T4 (Statement of Remuneration Paid) is available for download on the eHR website by the end of February.  To access, log into my.torontomu.ca and click on the eHR tab. Go to Self Service > Payroll and Compensation > View T4/T4A Slips. If you have problems with your tax information please contact the ServiceHub."
