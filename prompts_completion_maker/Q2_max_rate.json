        "prompt": "Can you explain the hourly rate range for each level, guild, and geography?",
        "completion": "For every level, for every guild, and for every geography we define a range of hourly rates. For instance, a level 1 Engineer in EG should normally charge between $18 and $27 per hour, and will have a Bill rate mid of $23. This hourly rate range is the default number that gets loaded in flow.bld.ai when a person is added to a project. However, it is always possible for a project manager (PM) to suggest a different rate. The minimum hourly rate is the Bill rate low, but there is no maximum. PMs can have conversations with clients to adjust rates for specific individuals, and this process is usually much faster than inflation."

        "prompt": "What is the maximum hourly rate that an individual can have across all guilds and geographies?",
        "completion": "The Global max mid bill rate is the maximum hourly rate that an individual can have across all guilds and geographies. This rate is the highest value that the middle range can take for an individual at that level. The level of control that this provides allows us to quickly and easily adjust everything globally in a way that is fair, transparent, and efficient."

        "completion": "We define a range of hourly rates for every level, guild, and geography. For example, a level 1 Engineer in EG should normally charge between $18 and $27 per hour, and will have a Bill rate mid of $23. This hourly rate range is set by taking into consideration several factors, including market research, benchmarking, and feedback from project managers and clients. It is always possible for a PM to suggest a different rate, but the minimum hourly rate is the Bill rate low, and there is no maximum. The Global max mid bill rate is the highest value that the middle range can take for an individual at that level across all guilds and geographies.
