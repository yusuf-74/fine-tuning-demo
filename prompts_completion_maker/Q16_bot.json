(If he needs no training, or can train individually)\",\n    \"completion\": \"Yes.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"prompt\": \"Is individual training required for new hires in a house of 1?\",\n    \"completion\": \"No, if the new hire needs no training or can train independently.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"prompt\": \"If a new hire requires training, can they still be a part of a house of 1?\",\n    \"completion\": \"Yes, as long as their training can be completed independently or without disrupting the workflow of the house of 1.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"prompt\": \"Can a new hire work in a house of 1 without any prior experience?\",\n    \"completion\": \"Yes, as long as they can perform the duties of their role effectively without needing extensive training.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"prompt\": \"Do new hires in a house of 1 need to be able to work independently?\",\n    \"completion\": \"Yes, in most cases, as the nature of a house of 1 often requires individual responsibility and self-motivation.\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or if there is anything else I can assist you with."
