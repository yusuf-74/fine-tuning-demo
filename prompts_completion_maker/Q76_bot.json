"Prompt examples:\n\n1. What is meant by housemasters not having direct control over workers in their house? \n\nCompletion example: \n- Workers' gross total compensation and expense contributions are determined by their house, and workers can choose the percentage they want to receive as vesting equity.   \n\n2. Can you explain how a worker's monthly contributions benefit their house? \n\nCompletion example: \n- If a worker charges a client $8,000 USD in a month, that gives their house $4,000. They may have also earned an extra $1,600 through proposal and recruiting, making a total house contribution of $6,600. \n\n3. How does a housemaster determine a worker's total cost to the house? \n\nCompletion example: \n- The housemaster sets the gross total compensation cost and expense contribution for each worker. For example, a worker may have a $5,200 gross total compensation cost and $300 expense contribution, making their total cost to the house $5,500. \n\n4. What does vesting equity mean in this context? \n\nCompletion example: \n- Workers can choose the percentage of their compensation they want to receive as vesting equity. For example, a worker may decide to take 20% of their $5,200 gross total compensation as vesting equity, which would be 104 units at $10/unit. \n\n5. How is a worker's final compensation calculated, taking into account various deductions and fees? \n\nCompletion example: \n- A worker may have health insurance coverage, tax deductions, bank fees, and foreign exchange considerations. If a worker were to take 20% of their $5,200 gross total compensation as vesting equity, and had deductions totaling $460, their final compensation would be $3,700. If the worker also had 200 vested shares, they could sell them after IPO, adding an additional $2,000 compensation (less applicable capital gains taxes). \n\nJSON examples: \n\n1. {\"prompt\": \"What is meant by housemasters not having direct control over workers in their house?\", \"completion\": \"Workers' gross total compensation and expense contributions are determined by their house, and workers can choose the percentage they want to receive as vesting equity.\"}\n\n2. {\"prompt\": \"Can you explain how a worker's monthly contributions benefit their house?\", \"completion\": \"If a worker charges a client $8,000 USD in a month, that gives their house $4,000.
