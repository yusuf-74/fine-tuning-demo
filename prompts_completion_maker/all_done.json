This hourly rate range is the default number that gets loaded in flow.bld.ai when a person is added to a project. However, it is always possible for a project manager (PM) to suggest a different rate. The minimum hourly rate is the Bill rate low, but there is no maximum. PMs can have conversations with clients to adjust rates for specific individuals, and this process is usually much faster than inflation."

This hourly rate range is set by taking into consideration several factors, including market research, benchmarking, and feedback from project managers and clients. It is always possible for a PM to suggest a different rate, but the minimum hourly rate is the Bill rate low, and there is no maximum.
