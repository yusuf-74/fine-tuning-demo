"Here are some examples in JSON:\n\n1. \n```\n{\n  \"prompt\": \"Will we need to sign new contracts? (Post compensation engine)\",\n  \"completion\": \"Yes, we will have to sign new contracts once the post compensation engine is implemented.\"\n}\n```\n\n2. \n```\n{\n  \"prompt\": \"Will we need to sign new contracts? (Post compensation engine)\",\n  \"completion\": \"No, we won't need to sign new contracts after the post compensation engine is implemented.\"\n}\n```\n\n3. \n```\n{\n  \"prompt\": \"Will we need to sign new contracts? (Post compensation engine)\",\n  \"completion\": \"I'm not sure, we'll have to wait and see what the impact of the post compensation engine is.\"\n}\n```\n\n4. \n```\n{\n  \"prompt\": \"Will we need to sign new contracts? (Post compensation engine)\",\n  \"completion\": \"It's possible we'll need to sign new contracts, but it hasn't been confirmed yet.\"\n}\n```\n\n5. \n```\n{\n  \"prompt\": \"Will we need to sign new contracts? (Post compensation engine)\",\n  \"completion\": \"Yes, we will definitely need to sign new contracts once the post compensation engine is implemented.\"\n}\n```"
