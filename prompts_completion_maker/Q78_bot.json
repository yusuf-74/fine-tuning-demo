        "prompt": "What are completions?",
        "completion": "Completions refer to the completion of tasks or projects that workers have worked on for clients. When a task is completed, the worker will input the completion into the engine along with any necessary information, such as the task/project name and completion date.\n\nCompletions are also audited to ensure that the work done meets the client's expectations and requirements."

        "prompt": "How are work logs audited?",
        "completion": "Work logs are heavily audited, they are checked by the PM of the project, the QA team and then once again once we bill the client. This is to ensure that the work done matches the client's expectations and requirements, and that the project is staying on track in terms of budget and time."

    {
        "prompt": "Who inputs work logs?",
        "completion": "Individual workers input their work logs for the work they do for different clients. They will include information such as the project they worked on, the task they completed, the hours spent on the task, and their hourly rate in the project. This information is used for billing the client and auditing the work done."

    {
        "prompt": "What is the purpose of work logs?",
        "completion": "The purpose of work logs is to provide an accurate and detailed record of the work done by individual workers for different clients.

    {
        "prompt": "Can work logs be edited once submitted?",
        "completion": "In general, work logs should not be edited once they are submitted. However, there may be situations where an error was made in inputting the information and the work log needs to be corrected. In these cases, the worker should reach out to the PM or QA team to request an edit. All changes should be documented and audited to ensure their accuracy."
    },
    {
        "prompt": "What happens if a work log is not approved by the QA team?",
        "completion": "If a work log is not approved by the QA team, it will be sent back to the worker for corrections or further clarification. The worker will need to revise the work log and resubmit it for approval. The QA team will continue to review the work log until it is approved, so that the client can be billed accurately and the work done meets their expectations and requirements."
