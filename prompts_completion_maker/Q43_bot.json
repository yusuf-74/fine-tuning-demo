        "completion": "The main question is about the transition from a fixed salary payment to a variable compensation payment, which may not have a predictable payment date, and whether there will be two pay cycles in the transition month."

        "prompt": "What is the information provided in the completion?",
        "completion": "The writer needs to comply with laws for salaried, full-time employees in the US and Canada. They currently pay on the 28th for work done in the current month, but need to transition to a payment within the 10th of the following month for work done in the previous month due to the constraints of the compensation engine. This may involve doing a transition payroll as needed to allow people to plan. The writer also mentions the difficulty of this transition due to different state laws and promises to inform people in advance."
