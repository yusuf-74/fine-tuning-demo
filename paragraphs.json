        "This session offered attendees the opportunity to deepen their understanding of the meaning of wampum and how they have a responsibility to learn about, recognize and uphold the treaties through the wampum belts. It\u2019s important to acknowledge that self-education and lifelong learning outside of the classroom is essential to Truth and Reconciliation.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0",

Collectively, our community has made great strides in our journey of Truth and Reconciliation, and while there is more work to be done,\u00a0 I am proud of our steadfast commitment to confront colonialism, racism and inequity.

        "Toronto Metropolitan University is named for Egerton Ryerson (1803-1882), a prominent figure in 19th-century Canada who played an influential role in the fields of politics, religion, arts, sciences and perhaps most significantly, education. Egerton Ryerson was instrumental in the establishment of a free and compulsory public education system in Ontario. This was the foundation of the province\u2019s modern school system and served to revolutionize education in Canada.",
        "Because of Egerton Ryerson\u2019s achievements, particularly in establishing the public education system we know today, the institution that would eventually become Toronto Metropolitan University was named for him at its founding in 1948.",
        "Toronto Metropolitan University is proud of its history and of the contribution its namesake, Egerton Ryerson, made to Ontario\u2019s public education system. However, while Egerton Ryerson supported free and compulsory education, he also believed in different systems of education for Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal children. These beliefs influenced, in part, the establishment of what became the Indian Residential School system that has had such a devastating impact on First Nations, M\u00e9tis and Inuit people across Canada. While Egerton Ryerson\u00a0 did not implement or oversee Indian Residential Schools, his ideas were used by others to create their blueprint. It is important to acknowledge this connection and in so doing emphasize the university\u2019s ongoing and proactive commitment to respectful relationships with Aboriginal communities, both within and outside Toronto Metropolitan University, and to continuing to build and maintain a campus environment that welcomes and respects Aboriginal people.",

In 2015, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission reported that children in the schools were subjected to unthinkable abuse and neglect, to medical experimentation, punishment for the practice of cultures or languages and death.

Subsequent Indigenous Nations and peoples, Europeans and all newcomers have been invited into this treaty in the spirit of peace, friendship and respect.\"",

That means we have to share the responsibility of ensuring the dish is never empty, which includes taking care of the land and the creatures we share it with. Importantly, there are no knives at the table, representing that we must keep the peace. The dish is graphically represented by the wampum pictured above.",

There was also a reluctance to acknowledge the harmful role played by the university\u2019s namesake.\u00a0",

The PDF fileCommission\u2019s Principles of Reconciliation provide the building blocks needed for reconciliation between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Canada to occur.

On Tuesday, March 7, the university\u2019s Senate approved the establishment of the school as a new faculty, allowing the project team to set up the structure for future undergraduate and postgraduate medical education programs and the eventual recruitment of part-time and full-time faculty and staff.",
        "The school of medicine will help address the current shortage of primary care physicians who are unevenly distributed across communities throughout the province. Additionally, as the health-care sector evolves to become a more integrated, coordinated system, there is an urgent need to train physicians with different skills, knowledge and experience that will allow them to meet the diverse health and social needs of communities to improve patient outcomes. The school will apply a learning model that emphasizes an outcomes-based approach to align learning outcomes to individualized needs, and prioritizes team-based care rooted in interprofessional and interdisciplinary collaboration.",

        "The school of medicine will be the first medical school in Canada founded and intentionally built upon social accountability, equity, diversity and inclusion and reconciliation. Located in Brampton, the school will be embedded into one of Canada\u2019s most culturally diverse and fastest growing cities. As its population grows, Brampton residents are experiencing significant challenges with access to appropriate, high-quality primary care - challenges that are reflected across similar communities in Ontario and across Canada. The school of medicine will not only build up the health-care system in the City of Brampton, but will also create space for a diverse pool of talent to address similar health needs experienced by Ontarians and Canadians more broadly.",
        "\u201cThe journey towards building a medical school from the ground up has been a real team effort,\u201d says the school of medicine\u2019s dean of record, Dr. Andrew Padmos. \u201cWe want to recognize and thank the hundreds of TMU students, faculty and staff who shared their knowledge and expertise through participation in planning committees, advisory councils and consultation sessions to get us to this important landmark on the road to opening the school of medicine.\u201d\u00a0",

        "When Kira Guloien found out she had landed a role in the Oscar-nominated film Women Talking- starring Academy Award winner Frances McDormand and directed by renowned Canadian writer/director Sarah Polley - she couldn\u2019t believe it.",
        "\u201cI was in the grocery store with my partner (when I found out). I hung up the phone and just looked at him - and we shared the longest, happiest hug in the laundry detergent aisle. It was very emotional,\u201d she said.",
        "Guloien, 32, who is originally from Edmonton, graduated in 2012 from Toronto Metropolitan University\u2019s theatre program (now known as Performance Acting), which is part of The Creative School.\u00a0",

        "It\u2019s the first movie she\u2019s been in that\u2019s been nominated for an Academy Award. Women Talking is up for both Best Picture and Best Adapted Screenplay at the Oscars on March 12.\u00a0",
        "The Best Adapted Screenplay Oscar nomination is Polley\u2019s second. Her first came in 2006 for the film Away from Her, also in the category of Best Screenplay. (Polley first became a household name in Canada when she played the role of Sarah Stanley in Road to Avonlea from 1990-1996.)",
        "Women Talking is based on a 2018 novel by Canadian author Miriam Toews, and inspired by true events that occurred in a Mennonite community in Bolivia between 2005 and 2009, when women were drugged and sexually abused by men.",
        "\u201cThe film is an imagined response of the women,\u201d Guloien said, explaining that some wanted to do nothing, some wanted to stay and fight, and others wanted to leave.",
        "\u201cI think this film will start a lot of important conversations,\u201d she said of the star-studded production, in which she plays the daughter of McDormand\u2019s character - a role that Polley wrote specifically for her.\u00a0",
        "Since her character is one of the women who chooses to \u201cdo nothing\u201d, Guloien notes that she doesn\u2019t actually have any lines in the film. Still, since her character is torn between honouring her mother\u2019s desire to stay, and protecting her young daughter - she says the role was a special opportunity since the character is pivotal.",
        "She also says that despite the gravity of the storyline, the experience during filming was remarkable.",
        "\"There was just so much humour on the set, and everyone checked egos at the door. It was a masterclass watching everyone work,\u201d she said, noting that a therapist was also on-set to help ensure it was a safe space. \u201cEveryone\u2019s voice was welcome at the table.\u201d",
        "When asked about advice to current students or other young actors, Guloien is quick to acknowledge the challenges of breaking into the industry.",
        "\u201cSo much of this industry is luck,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat\u2019s important is to do the best you can with what you can control- which is to work hard.\u201d",
        "\u201cIf you\u2019re not currently hired, hire yourself,\u201d she added, noting the importance of creating opportunities and \u201cputting yourself out there\u201d.\u00a0",

        "Last month, the university led a series of town halls to share the budget planning process and considerations for the 2023-24 academic year, and to solicit feedback from our community members on what matters most to them in planning for the future.\u00a0",
        "We heard from our community that teaching and learning, mental health and well-being, and campus safety were priorities, as was transparency throughout the budget process itself. The town halls were a valuable opportunity for conversation between the administration and our students, faculty and staff and we thank those who were able to attend in person or virtually.\u00a0",
        "In the spirit of transparency and in support of prudent fiscal planning it is important for all of our community members to be aware that the university is currently experiencing a budget gap of at least $16.9 million. This is the result of a number of on-going challenges, including frozen domestic tuition fees since 2019, fixed enrolment corridors, and limited government funding. These challenges have been compounded by the lingering effects of the pandemic including inflation and a negative impact on international student enrolments.",
        "To support the financial health of our university, all units have been asked to plan for a 3.5 per cent base budget reduction across the university. All departments have been asked to assess their current budgets to make a reduction; this review and collaboration has been taking place over the last number of weeks. Leaders have been asked to submit their plans for 2023-24, including how they will reduce their budget by 3.5 per cent.",

The university does expect constrained operating revenues to continue while costs will continue to increase due to normal escalations and new inflationary pressures.\u00a0",

        "Imagine it is lunchtime at your school and you are getting ready to eat, when someone makes a critical comment about your food\u2019s appearance, smell or that it is different.",
        "Research by Toronto Metropolitan University professional communication professor Yukari Seko found that mealtime at schools in the Greater Toronto Area can be fraught for students who find themselves at the centre of unwanted attention due to the contents of their lunch boxes. She is furthering conversations about how more culturally inclusive discussions about topics like healthy eating could benefit everyone. ",
        "Professor Seko\u2019s Lunchbox Shaming Research Project is partly inspired by her own observations from sending her son to school with Japanese-style lunches. She is digging into the experiences of students from Asian backgrounds during their midday meals. Youth reported receiving negative comments from their peers or attracting other critical attention as a result of bringing food from their family\u2019s culinary culture, instead of more \u201cnormal\u201d western lunch items like sandwiches or pasta. ",
        "\u201cMany of the participants shared heartbreaking stories with us,\u201d said Seko about the youth aged 17 to 25 from the Chinese, Indian and Filipino communities interviewed as part of her project and who reflected on their school lunch experiences. Researchers heard stories of food shaming that drove some of the participants to take actions like hiding their lunch or even throwing away the meal. Similar patterns of negative experience were noted across all three groups, and professor Seko points out that Chinese, Indian and Filipino immigrants make up about 40 per cent of the immigrants who settled in Toronto between 2011 and 2016. ",
        "An earlier pilot phase of the project examined the experiences of young students with Japanese ancestry through arts-based research and by conducting focus groups with their mothers. \u201cWe found that the Japanese-style lunch box is a conduit of passing the culinary tradition down to the next generation,\u201d said Seko. However, she found the experiences of the kids at schools to be what she calls a \u201cfood culture mismatch\u201d between the home and institutional eating environments.\u00a0 ",
        "That mismatch occurs in a number of ways, she explains. Many kinds of Asian food are best served warm, and many school lunch setups do not accommodate that. There are some cultural traditions \u2013 like in Japanese culture \u2013 where all the food served should be eaten, she says, but the time allotted for lunch doesn\u2019t allow for students to finish their meal, leaving them feeling rushed. Then there is the scrutiny and negative feedback from other students about the food itself. ",
        "As part of Seko\u2019s pilot project research, she recommends a more culturally inclusive approach to conversations around healthy eating, rather than formal guides written through a western lens. Such an approach would help children and families explore their food identities. Instead of banning commentary in school to avoid offense, she suggests educators can help expose children to different food cultures and learn to negotiate social and emotional boundaries. Exercises can be as simple as encouraging children to unpack their lunch boxes together and explore how their lunches are made. Findings were recently published in both the journal Canadian Food Studies, external link, and as a case in the open textbook Food Studies, external link.",
        "Seko\u2019s project will continue with a second phase of arts-informed research with children aged eight to 12 years old and their parents in summer 2022. She hopes to potentially expand the project, including co-creating curriculum to facilitate discussions at schools about food. ",

        "Researchers from TMU and St. Michael\u2019s Hospital can detect brain tumour content using blood samples. Called a liquid biopsy, this could transform how cancers are screened in the future.",
        "As little as five microlitres of blood could be used to detect tumour content in cancer patients with incredibly high accuracy, according to Toronto Metropolitan University (TMU) and Unity Health Toronto researchers from the Institute for Biomedical Engineering, Science and Technology (iBEST).\u00a0",
        "TMU professors and iBEST members Bo Tan (Aerospace Engineering) and Krishnan Venkatakrishnan (Mechanical Engineering), along with postdoctoral fellows Rupa Haldavnekar and Swarna Ganesh have been working with Dr. Sunit Das, a neurosurgeon and scientist from St. Michael\u2019s Hospital, a site of Unity Health Toronto, using a highly sensitive nanosensor to test blood samples. The nanosensor, a small device that measures physical quantities and turns them into signals, can detect cancer biomarkers in blood. This practice is referred to as a liquid biopsy and can effectively detect cancer in patients before the more conventional practices of imagery (MRIs) or traditional tissue biopsies.\u00a0",
        "\u201cThe way we monitor cancer patients is to have an MRI every three months,\u201d said Das. \u201cNo one has a system that would allow us to do MRIs every week, but conceivably, we could do a blood test every week. This could be a surveillance tool that could give oncologists a heads up about changes in their patient\u2019s cancer.\u201d",
        "The health-care system in Ontario is currently facing staffing shortages and longer wait times for procedures, in part due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Das says that the liquid biopsy could have a significant impact on the current wait times patients are experiencing due to a lack of resources needed for traditional cancer screenings.\u00a0",
        "The group has tested hundreds of blood samples for the past two years. Most recently they were able to use the nanosensor to detect brain cancer content in blood, external link, which until now, was incredibly difficult to do due to the limited amount of blood in the brain. Tumours were detected with 100 per cent accuracy and tumour location was detected with 97 per cent accuracy, making the liquid biopsy a reliable source for deep surveillance of brain cancer, something that currently doesn\u2019t exist.\u00a0",
        "\u201cRight now, most cancers are diagnosed at stages two, three, four,\u201d said Tan. \u201cIf the blood test can detect tumour content, we can catch them at a very early stage, before the patient even shows symptoms.\u201d",
        "Long-term, the research group is looking to make the liquid biopsy a common cancer screening tool for high-risk patients. For example, Tan says the liquid biopsy could be done on an annual basis for early detection purposes in people who have family history with cancer.",
        "\u201cCOVID really accelerated the use of artificial intelligence in medical practice,\u201d said Das. \u201cIf we were talking about this liquid biopsy research three years ago (pre-COVID), I would have said a development like this would take 10 years. Now I think it could be possible in four or five years.\u201d",
        "They are currently testing blood samples for tumour content accuracy with common cancers like breast, lung and colon. Das says that this could be more than a cancer diagnostic tool, too. The nanosensor has the potential to look for brain injury or multiple-sclerosis biomarkers in blood.\u00a0",
        "\u201cCongratulations to professors Tan and Venkatakrishnan and their collaborators on this important advancement in cancer detection,\u201d said Steven N. Liss, TMU\u2019s vice-president, research and innovation. \u201cThe highly sensitive nanosensors developed by this team represents impactful research and is an excellent example of how collaboration between researchers and clinicians can accelerate critical health innovations.\u201d",

        "If you're ever looking for researcher James Gr\u00e4fe, you would be advised to check his schedule.  Four days of the work week, Gr\u00e4fe is based at Ryerson University, where he's a professor in the Department of Physics. On the remaining day, though, he can be found at a local hospital, where as a clinical medical physicist, he ensures cancer patients receive the correct dose of radiation, precisely where it's needed to treat their disease.  \"I'm essentially a pharmacist for radiation,\" he says of his work at the Odette Cancer Centre, part of Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre. Indeed, Gr\u00e4fe's entire career is directed toward improving patient care, whether that means optimizing a course of treatment or preparing the next generation of clinical professionals.  For example, as a certified member of the Canadian College of Physicists in Medicine, Gr\u00e4fe serves as an important instructor and mentor for biomedical students in Ryerson's graduate-level Option in Medical Physics. The specialized stream, which is accredited by the Commission on Accreditation of Medical Physics Educational Programs, enables Ryerson students, if they wish, to apply to post-graduate residency programs in medical physics.  Gr\u00e4fe is constantly looking for new ways to advance students' knowledge and skills. For instance, thanks to a partnership he developed with clinical medical physicist Rao Khan at the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis (WUSM), Ryerson students have the opportunity to work with state-of-the-art radiation therapy equipment.",
        "For instance, under Gr\u00e4fe and Khan's supervision, Ryerson biomedical physics PhD student Shadab Momin is currently based at WUSM. There, he's using dual energy X-ray treatment technology to explore how to improve the quality of radiation treatment plans.",
        "Another example of leading-edge technology at WUSM is a proton therapy machine. The expensive piece of equipment, which isn't currently available in Canada, could potentially reduce the damage that radiation therapy inflicts on non-cancerous cells in the body for some select disease sites.  Gr\u00e4fe uses the proton technology to study the nuclear and atomic interactions that occur when a contrast agent containing the element gadolinium is introduced into the body in order to view and assess a tumor. The goal is to develop a way of tracking a tumor's position and response to radiation treatment in real time.  \"It would give us an extra degree of confidence,\u201d says Gr\u00e4fe, noting the work is an extension of his concurrent research on rare earth metals and their connection to bone health. That project has received funding from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada.  Finally, Gr\u00e4fe is working with McMaster University researchers to study gadolinium retention. More recently, the team found that some patients continued to retain the metal five years after being administered a gadolinium-based contrast agent before undergoing an MRI scan. The research will be published in the latest issue of the journal Radiology.  \"This is important as gadolinium has no known biological role and can be toxic in high quantities,\" says Gr\u00e4fe. \"These agents should be completely eliminated from the body.\"  Gr\u00e4fe\u2019s research has received additional support from Ryerson's Faculty of Science and the Department of Physics.",

        "Ryerson's graduate programs in biomedical physics have received a five-year extension of a prestigious accreditation and Ana Pejovi\u0107-Mili\u0107, chair of the Department of Physics, is clear about the significance of the accomplishment. \"This is the biggest achievement for the department since it was established in 2006,\" she says.",
        "Both the master's and PhD programs in biomedical physics, which offer an option in medical physics, have once again earned full accreditation from the Commission on Accreditation of Medical Physics Educational Programs (CAMPEP). The specialized stream first received CAMPEP's stamp of approval in 2012, and in a rare move, the accrediting body approved Ryerson's application for an extension without recommending any program changes or requiring a site visit. The current accreditation term will apply through to Dec. 31, 2022.",
        "As the lone CAMPEP-accredited program in the Greater Toronto Area, and one of only a dozen across Canada, Ryerson's pathway ensures graduates have the necessary knowledge and skills to pursue a career in medical physics. Indeed, completion of a CAMPEP-accredited program is mandatory for applicants to post-graduate residency programs in the field. Students then focus on, for example, radiation oncology, diagnostic radiology or nuclear medicine.",
        "The training process is long and rigorous for good reason. A clinical medical physicist plays a critical role in the process of treating cancer with radiation therapy. Precision is key; he or she must ensure the right amount of radiation is delivered exactly where it's needed to treat the disease.",
        "Ryerson students develop an understanding of clinical practice and research through the physics department's close relationship with the Odette Cancer Centre, part of Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre. In fact, 25 per cent of students in the CAMPEP-accredited stream are doing their research projects at the hospital.\u00a0",
        "Among the six students who have graduated from the master's program to date, five are now pursuing a PhD and one works in the high-tech sector. Meanwhile, one of the two PhD-program graduates is now a postdoctoral research associate at the Washington University School of Medicine and the other is a medical physics resident at Northwell Health in New York.",
        "The broad range of academic and career options available to graduates reflects the diverse topics they explore at Ryerson, says Carl Kumaradas, graduate program director in the physics department. Along with biomedical physics professors James Gr\u00e4fe and Vladislav Toronov, Kumaradas wrote the highly detailed report upon which CAMPEP based its decision.",
        "\"The extension demonstrates that Ryerson's program meets CAMPEP's stringent standards, including oversight of students' progress, access to high-quality student mentorship and a strong record of success among our graduates,\u201d says Kumaradas. \"It also shows that our program delivers professionally relevant training for our graduate students.\"",

It will normally be a reading course under the direct supervision of an assigned faculty member with expertise in the chosen subject field. The course requirements will be negotiated on an individual basis with the supervising faculty member, in consultation with the Graduate Program Director. 1 Credit",
        "CR8201 - Historical Criminology This course will examine the development of modern criminal justice institutions and the logic that underpins them. It reflects on historical processes of criminalization and their social impact in producing and perpetuating inequalities. It will also provide an introduction to the methodological approaches that historians employ to learn about the past, with the aim to deepen student's understanding of crime, the criminal justice system, and the campaigns for social justice they inspire. 1 Credit",
        "CR8202 \u2013 Crime and Technology This course builds on criminological studies of crime in the \u201ccyber society\u201d where daily life cannot be understood independent of technologies like the internet and the smartphone. This course asks how the development of technologies like social media and the surveillance camera have affected crime and crime control. Each week, students will discuss a specific technology\u2019s role in crime and crime control. 1 Credit",
        "CR8203 \u2013 Immigration and Crime This course will explore whether the public perception, that increasing immigration and higher levels of crime are inextricably linked, is supported by evidence. After providing an introduction to the various theories examining the relationship between immigration and crime, this course will survey the empirical research both at the individual- level and at the aggregate-level on the relationship between immigration and crime. There will be an ongoing focus on debates about key issues. 1 Credit",
        "CR8204 \u2013 Security Threats This graduate seminar examines the ways radicalization to violence/violent extremism (RTV/VE) is constituted and managed in Canada. Drawing on critical and interdisciplinary research and theory, we examine the etiology, manifestations and consequences of this violence, and conclude with an examination of tactics used to respond to RTV/VE, with an emphasis on the disconnect between heavy reliance on \u2018hard security strategies\u2019 and what the evidence base has to say about their efficacy. 1 Credit",
        "CR8205 \u2013 Colonial Abolition This course will examine theoretical frames and political approaches to justice that build upon Indigenous legal orders and political movements. It will draw on the Black Radical and abolitionist traditions, examining intersections \u2013 both convergent and divergent \u2013 between Black and Indigenous refusals of state solutions to state-induced violence, while analyzing respective histories and impacts of racial, gender, class and colonial oppression and containment. 1 Credit",
        "CR8206 \u2013 Criminalization of Black Women\u2019s Dissent In this seminar, we focus on the historical and present day perspectives of Black women who have experienced processes of criminalization for their acts of civil disobedience, activism and defiance to violent systems in their life, by a close read of three autobiographical and biographical texts and one podcast. In-depth topics include: processes of criminalization, perceptions of crime,respectability politics, violence, acts of resistance, and interactions with the criminal justice system. 1 Credit",

What started out as a response to fiction or an adjunct to the dominant form now seems to have merged, in the audience\u2019s eyes at least, into some sort of hybrid, postmodern comment on reality.

Informing this survey of contemporary works will be the seminal theoretical works that have mapped out the precarious philosophical terrain the form insists on cultivating. 1 Credit",

The course examines both key documents in cultural theory and the manifestos issued by various groups and is concerned particularly with artists who attempted to forge a link between political revolution and a revolution in consciousness. The role the cinema played in all these artistic movements is given special consideration, as is the re-contextualization of this work as a document of its own culture and time.

This course looks at critical writings on digital media, with a particular focus on publications and online sources from the last decade. Relations between developments in critical theory and the rapid evolution of the technologies of digital media are actively tracked throughout the course; as are ways in which digital media aggregate to form new collections of digital documents. 1 Credit  DM8305 Databases, Archives and the Virtual Experience of Art Visual information takes on different forms in the digital realm, and multifaceted databases accumulate more and more of this information. Our perceptual and social understandings of images -- even our cultural identities and memories -- are increasingly stored in systems through which only reproductions and virtual images can be retrieved. This course examines the larger implications of this phenomenon for image makers as well as for societies and cultures. 1 Credit",
        "DM8306 Enabling Technologies and the Illusions of Knowledge: Studies in Culture and Perception This course looks at ways in which enabling technologies increase the malleability of visual records and visual documents.

        " An entry in the Sage Encyclopedia of Children and Childhood Studies (2020) explains that childhood studies is a multidisciplinary academic field focused on childhood and the everyday lives of children. Integrating equity, diversity and inclusion into early childhood studies, Toronto Metropolitan University's Master of Arts in Early Childhood Studies is unique in North America. Terms such as \"diversity\" and \"inclusion\" are used in the broadest sense to include issues of linguistic, cultural and racial identity as well as disability, gender, class, sexuality, age and migration status. This approach is in recognition of a child's need to develop a positive identity, not only as an individual but also as a member of a group. In this program, you will develop a deep understanding of the complex issues connected to children in contemporary society. ",

        "Like each member of the Elders Council for the District of Temiskaming, Marie Boucher has a unique role: she provides spiritual guidance and support to Indigenous people in the region who seek out her assistance. So, when Ryerson graduate student\u00a0Nicole Ineese-Nash, Early Childhood Studies (master\u2019s) '17, a member of Constance Lake First Nation, asked the Elders Council to review her research on Indigenous children's experiences with disability support services, Boucher knew the process would create a strong emotional bridge between the two generations.",
        "\"It was a great honour to be in Nicole's presence [at the defence presentation] and to see how much she has achieved,\" Boucher says.",
        "Last August, Ineese-Nash presented the findings from her\u00a0major research paper (MRP) for her master's degree in Early Childhood Studies (ECS). Except, instead of defending her research in front of a few faculty members at Ryerson, she spoke in Temiskaming to a group of 20 people that included not only academics, but also her loved ones and local community members.",
        "The location and audience weren't the only unique aspects of Ineese-Nash's thesis defence. The presentation also featured an opening prayer, song and cleansing smudge ceremony. What's more, rather than choosing a single second reader to sit on the oral examination committee, Ineese-Nash chose the six members of Temiskaming's Elders Council \u2013 Boucher (Matachewan), Mario Batisse (Matachewan), Marilyn Chevrier-Willis (Temiskaming First Nation), Marcia Brown-Martel (Beaverhouse First Nation), Tom Wabie (Beaverhouse First Nation) and Lilianne Ethier (Metis Nation Temiskaming Community Council).",
        "Ineese-Nash's research presentation focused on her home Oji-Cree community of Constance Lake First Nation in northern Ontario.

        "My name is Iman Bundu. I'm a student and aspiring cultural worker. The seeds of my interest in film began in earnest, through free trials for pay-per-view movie channels. They only continued to grow when I began university and recognized film as a viable object of study, completing my undergrad in Cinema Studies and Critical Equity and Solidarity Studies at the University of Toronto.  Throughout the course of my time there, my interests were equally, if not more, informed by developments happening in the film world at large. I supplemented my education by attending talks, workshops and screenings. This led to a newfound awareness of advancements in film restoration, as previously lost or underseen works, became more widely available. The advancements intersected with newfound calls for on screen representation by marginalized groups, a necessary endeavour but one which in the mainstream, tends toward one dimensional portraits in blockbusters to satiate viewers and quiet critiques.\u00a0  Suffice to say, this has informed my own passion to illuminate film histories across the globe, to challenge ahistorical understandings of the medium as well as trouble some of the more deeply embedded myths of who connotes a pioneer. A multidisciplinary approach has always steered my academic pursuits and serves as the basis for my goals. It's a distinct honour and privilege to have been awarded this scholarship, for a program which feels uniquely attuned to my interests. It will allow me to study at renowned institutions worldwide to gain first hand experiential knowledge and open up the possibility of exploring other threads of interest I may come across in my studies.  ",
        "As a person who has been working on many Iranian news agencies and newspapers as a head-Journalist, a senior editor, and a photographer, I had to start nearly from scratch by attending a series of courses ranging from the history of art and postmodernism to feminism. I came across the Film and Photography Preservation and Collections Management program at Ryerson University during my research. I have become highly interested in areas of practice and study offered and worked on at Ryerson. Being exposed to diverse traditions and studying in a more critical and creative environment will enhance my visual/critical thinking ability.",

I completed my undergraduate studies in Professional Photojournalism at the School of Media Studies in Tehran, Iran. My early research focused on middle eastern performance art, cinema, fine arts, women, and ethnic minorities -Iranian Arabs- for almost ten years.",

For that, the program will fund my project and let me use the facilities to achieve the goal. Also, when I won the \u201cF+PPCM scholarship\u201d, I felt confident that I could plan for my future projects. Solving my financial worries as an international student, enriching my library, and completing my photo collections in line with my final project are some of the positive effects this scholarship can have on my future. This fund was given to me by the university, which proved to be a supporter to me at the beginning, and I am proud of that, and I tried that I can use this fund to be successful in my future career.",

A draft proposal for this topic will be developed through the required course IS8904 - Research Methods. The MRP research and writing will be conducted under supervision of a faculty member selected by the student. The MRP will be evaluated by the supervisor and a second reader, and will involve an oral review. This is a \u201cMilestone\u201d. Pass/Fail",
        "IS8100 Seminar and Field Placement This course prepares students to complete a 150-hour field placement at an organization engaged in immigration or settlement policy or programs, allowing students to link classroom learning to work experience. During the Winter term, students attend presentations by practitioners on policy, service delivery, and advocacy. Typically, students complete their placement during the Spring/Summer term. Post-placement, students share their placement experiences at a symposium and submit a reflective report on their personal and professional learning. Pass/Fail",
        "IS8901 The Canadian Immigration Experience This course examines the Canadian immigration experience as an interplay of government policy towards newcomers, and the lives immigrants have made for themselves through migration. Key themes explored in the Canadian approaches to immigrant admission and integration include the significance of state authority, economic interests, presumptions of race and gender as drivers of immigration policy. Transnationalism is then emphasized as central to understanding the experience of immigrants attached to both Canada and their homeland. 1 Credit",
        "IS8902 The Settlement Experience in Canada This course examines the experiences of immigrants and refugees who have settled in Canada, and the social, cultural and political processes of their integration and/or marginalization. In this context, it explores immigrant- based institutions and social movements, and equitable approaches to service provision and community development. Comparisons will occasionally be made to other countries. Students will develop an understanding of the migrants\u2019 lived experiences and the practical interventions that may reproduce or challenge processes of marginalization. 1 Credit",
        "IS8903 Imm Law, Policies, Politics, & Practices Immigration policy and law determine who is admitted to Canada. The formulation and implementation of immigration policy involves the complex integration of factors such as demographic trends, labour market conditions, human rights and the well-being and opportunity of immigrants. This course examines the politics of the decision-making process which defines Canadian immigration policy. Students will be encouraged to focus on policy analysis from the perspective of the immigrant, practitioner and the critic of immigration policy. 1 Credit",
        "IS8904 Research Meth. in Imm. & Sett. Studies This course is designed to prepare students to work on their required Major Research Paper (MRP) with a faculty supervisor. The principal components of this preparation are an articulation of one\u2019s research topic of interest, a thorough review of the existing literature on the topic, an overview of available methods, an explicit consideration of ethical issues in their research and student conference-style presentations to their classmates of their research ideas and methodological choices. 1 Credit",
        "IS8921 Equity for Newcomers: Schools Educational policies and practices routinely disadvantage migrants, and especially those without language skills in English or French. Educational equity in Canada will be explored in terms of: research and theory on social dominance; attempts by educational organizations to develop processes that are friendly to immigrant families; and research on the educational experiences of first and second generation immigrant children and their parents. 1 Credit",
        "IS8922 Changing Multicultural Mosaic of the GTA This course has two related objectives: to examine the migration and settlement experiences of diverse immigrant and refugee groups in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA), and in doing so, evaluate whether the GTA is indeed a multicultural space. Throughout this course, we will critically examine various concepts such as \u2018race\u2019, ethnicity, visible minority, class, gender, immigrant, refugee, and citizenship. 1 Credit",
        "IS8923 Immigrants\u2019 Voices in Canadian Literature The radical transformation of Canadian Literature into a robust body of writing occurred during the twentieth century, a period of intense immigration to this country. This course will examine a range of work by newly arrived and not-so newly arrived writers and will consider how identity is affected by the physical and cultural upheaval that characterizes the immigrant\u2019s experience. Whether and how the \u201cself\u201d is (re)constituted through immigration narratives will be considered. 1 Credit",
        "IS8924 The Economics of Immigration Labour economic theory and economic models of migration are applied to the context of immigration with particular emphasis on labour market outcomes of immigrants compared to the Canadian-born population. The topics include: effects of immigration on labour market outcomes; immigrants' earnings; and public spending and social assistance. Economic push and pull factors behind immigration flows are also examined, along with issues such as economic effects of migration on the source country. 1 Credit",
        "IS8925 Global Migration & Population Movements Scholarly records demonstrate that geographic mobility, not permanence, has been dynamic in shaping human settlements around the world. Historically the state often aimed to restrict population movements, however, sometimes it fostered migration through slavery, deportation, and colonialism. Today, ecological factors, demographic and economic pressures, political instability, wars, and social disruptions all precipitate voluntary and involuntary population movements. Interdisciplinary literature is reviewed, to compare patterns of population movements and migrations, and gendered relations of displacement globally. 1 Credit",
        "IS8926 Women, Immigration, and Settlement This course offers an analytical and theoretical orientation to understanding how immigrant women\u2019s lives are shaped by the intersection between gender, social class, race, ethnicity, and immigrant status. We will explore the history of Canadian immigrant women through the periods of colonization, agrarian transformation, nation state formation, industrialization, and globalization. Through these time periods, we will uncover patterns in the shaping of immigrant women\u2019s economic, political, and social rights, together with the attendant changing historical images of immigrant women. Particular attention will be paid to the changing nature of immigration policy, and immigrant women\u2019s settlement experiences \u2013 focusing on the multiple effects of immigrant status, gender, and race on employment and community life. 1 Credit",
        "IS8927 Imm. Families & Intergenerational Relations This course will explore family and intergenerational relations in the immigration and settlement process, premised on an appreciation of diversity in kinship and family structures. Continuities and changes in family relationships and roles are discussed, as they pertain to family separation and reunification, and transnational family lives. The experiences of elders, adults, youth and children are analyzed, in the light of the different sets of challenges they face in the receiving society. 1 Credit",
        "IS8928 Law Enforcement in Canada\u2019s Imm. System Terrorism, criminality, and undocumented migration are among the most contentious immigration issues. This course will address the legal and procedural mechanisms used to bar some people entry to Canada. We will discuss how and why Canada perceives threats to its public and national security interests, and what effect such definitions have on certain immigrant groups. We will shed light on the perspectives of both the law enforcement establishment and potential entrants to Canada. 1 Credit",
        "IS8929 Issues of Aging in Settlement This course examines some of the historical, sociological, legal, and residential issues that are part of the immigration and settlement experience of older immigrants to Canada. Their issues revolve around the economic, social, and other supports available from family, friends and the wider community. We will address how gender, race, language, and education combine to inform the experiences of exclusion and inclusion, dependency and independence, of aging immigrants in Canadian society. 1 Credit",
        "IS8930 Race and Racialization This course is constructed on the premise that racism and ethnocentrism have been and continue to be prominent features of Canadian society, which have challenged the dominant institutions. The course will examine the historical roots, contemporary manifestations and continual reproduction of racism, starting at the point of first contact between European colonizers and Aboriginal peoples, and continuing to draw examples from the subsequent patterns of immigration including the most recent attention to racialized minority immigrants. 1 Credit",
        "IS8931 Refugee Issues Refugees are populations and individuals who have been displaced across and within borders for reasons of persecution, expulsion, war, violence, and violations of fundamental human rights, security, and livelihood, including environmental causes. This course will address the accommodation, protection, and assistance for refugees through asylum, settlement, resettlement and reintegration. The policies and actions of governments and non-governmental organizations are explored critically, based on an analysis of the multiple consequences on refugees' lives, of their displacement. 1 Credit",
        "IS8932 Immigration and Health Newly arriving immigrants are, on average, healthier than native-born Canadians. They do not always stay that way. This course will address personal and social determinants of physical and mental health, and paradigms used to explain the health status of immigrants. Culturally appropriate health care requires institutional change, but this has been slow in coming. We will examine why, despite universal coverage, Canada's health care system is still failing to provide equitable services for immigrants and refugees. 1 Credit",
        "IS8934 Multicultural Cities-Planning Policy Recent immigration patterns have prompted an exploration of local governments' provision of urban facilities, services and infrastructures. We will address how modern cities of diverse cultures evolve and what policy approaches can sustain them. The course offers a mix of theoretical explanations about the geographic, political and economic bases of multicultural cities and a critical review of current policies and planning practices. It compares cities around the world, with a focus on Greater Toronto Area. Antirequisite: PL8101. 1 Credit",
        "IS8935 Migration and Language Many newcomers to Canada arrive with a good knowledge of one official language, which makes their integration to Canadian society much easier. Others, though, for whom English and French are not familiar languages face several obstacles to their full integration. In this course, students will be presented with the current status regarding language accommodations in the public sector, while being made aware of some of the difficulties associated with language in implementing Canada\u2019s immigration policies. 1 Credit",
        "IS8936 Migration and Identities Theoretical approaches are introduced regarding the connections between migration policies and practices, and the people who engage in them. The main approaches are feminist, critical race, and queer theory, and theories of citizenship belonging. We will engage in critical analysis of transnational and intra-national movements of migration while attending to how identities are shaped in the process. We will explore identities and migration and their connection to the state, social institutions, and personal experience. 1 Credit",
        "IS8937 Directed Study This course provides for individual directed study of a subject area in Immigration and Settlement Studies not available in the curriculum. The course is carried out under the supervision of a faculty member, and requires a program of supervised study and regular meetings between a student and a faculty member in an area of study related to the student\u2019s area of research. 1 Credit",
        "IS8938 Western Muslims and Liberalism This course examines the experiences of Muslims in Western liberal societies as citizens and social-political subjects rather than cultural aliens or permanent immigrants. Using contemporary approaches in migration studies such as transnational practices, cultural hybridity and pluralism we will develop a complex analysis of recent instances when notions of \"Muslim\" identity or '\u00b7Islam' were seen to clash with liberal individualism, democracy and human rights in Western Europe and North America. 1 Credit",

The primary focus is on the theories related to the administrative state and its role in the policy process. The course examines theoretical origins and evolution of public administration as a distinct and interdisciplinary field of intellectual inquiry and research in the broader context of the evolution of the administrative state and its relations with the private and non-profit sectors. An emphasis is placed on theoretical debates and research approaches to understanding the role of the administrative state in policy making, design and implementation for application in any policy area or jurisdiction. The focus will be less on the changing practices, issues and functional areas in public administration and more on the changing concepts and theories that attempt to explain the role and significance of the bureaucracy in public policy. 1 Credit",
        "PD9102 Immigration, Settlement and Diaspora Policies This course provides advanced examination of policy challenges arising from global migration. This course introduces students to various theoretical and disciplinary approaches to migration. A particular objective is situating Canada\u2019s policy responses in a comparative context with other traditional countries of migration, as well as more recent countries of immigrant settlement. Attention will be devoted to analyzing the role of the state, markets and civil society in shaping migration-related policies. The role of research in policy development and analysis is a recurring course theme. Topics of interest include the policy ramifications of immigration, settlement and diaspora related to such issues as: optimal population size, economic imperatives, multiculturalism, newcomer integration, dual citizenship, transnationalism and refugee admission. 1 Credit",
        "PD9103 Social Policy This course takes a historical, comparative and critical approach to the study of social policy. The focus is on key theories and perspectives in social policy and the fluid boundaries between social policy, economic policy, health policy, environmental policy and justice policy underpinning interdisciplinary approaches to social policy research. Through an emphasis on the political economy of social welfare policy development at the local, national and international levels, the course provides students with an understanding of the evolution of social conditions and examines the influence of different policy ideas, institutions and interests on social policy development and change. This course also examines social capital, social cohesion, diversity and social justice movements.

        "PC8002 Professional Communication: History, Theory, Practice This course examines how diverse practices of professional communication have evolved and merged into a defined discipline supported by a body of interdisciplinary research. Moving from past to present, we will investigate how the recent shift from traditional to digital and from local to global communication practices and processes has transformed the foundations of professional practice including strategic planning, ethics, and interpersonal, organizational and public communication. Looking towards the future within a media ecology framework, we will theorize the ways current and imagined techno-global communication practices may impact sustainability on social, economic, political, ethical, and environmental levels. Throughout the course, we will consider how the shift from mechanistic to systems thinking provides new research methods and theoretical models to study these complex and dynamic processes. 1 Credit",

        "PC8102 Communication and Legal Issues This course introduces students to the legal dimensions of professional communication through a variety of practical and theoretical approaches with a strong emphasis on semiotics, especially semantics and syntactics. Students will study the Canadian legal system as it applies to ethical responsibility and legal risk in the written and oral messages exchanged within and between organizations and will consider the degree to which legal formalism and legal realism operate in the determination of judicial decisions. Using detailed case analyses of documents such as briefs, letters, proposals, contracts, and reports, students will examine legal formats and structures, evidence and argumentation, copyright and intellectual property, and \u201cplain language\u201d writing. Students will learn to identify potential risks, and to prepare and manage communications that are clear, accessible, ethical and legal. 1 Credit",

In particular, we will apply different schools of thought to different contexts of professional communication by examining the ways that this web of medial relationships both enables and hinders our professional communication practices. 1 Credit",
        "PC8104 Crisis Communication Crises can weaken an organization's reputation, diminish employee commitment, and, as numerous historical examples have shown, destroy companies. Communication professionals must know how to predict, prevent, and manage crises. This course explores the theory and practice of crisis communication in a variety of sectors. Using case studies, students examine and analyze the natures of crises; the roles of employees, the media (traditional and electronic), and the public; theories of crisis management and crisis communication; and the role of the communication professional. The stakeholder dialectic and deliberative rhetoric theories are two frameworks that govern the course's investigation into crisis communication modes. 1 Credit",

Through a theoretical framework grounded in classical and modern rhetoric, meta-rhetoric, and narratology, students will explore how professional communicators construct polished arguments to generate support. From the perspective of both grant seekers and multidisciplinary peer-review audiences, students will learn how to identify and target government, foundation, and corporate funding sources/opportunities, to translate project goals and problem statements into clear objectives and hypotheses reflective of societal need, and to coordinate activities in the planning, development, structuring, and articulation of feasible, methodologically rigorous, and conceptually innovative research projects/proposals. Students will also gain practice in applying these techniques to fundraising initiatives and tasks including outreach and the cultivation of potential foundation and corporate donors. 1 Credit",

They will study the concepts underlying media relations, and how to employ them in strategic planning, image management, advocacy, and both proactive and reactive interaction with the press. Through a critical analysis of what actually makes a story newsworthy and of how news organizations function, students will learn how to craft and deliver the kind of sharply defined messages that are effective in today\u2019s 24/7 news cycle. 1 Credit",
        "PC8108 Visual Rhetoric in Professional Contexts John Berger tells us that \u201cseeing comes before words.\u201d Donis Dondis writes that \u201cthere is little rest in the process of seeing\u201d. In all of our dealings with the world, we constantly use images to persuade others, but we also become used by the same images. Drawing on the field of visual social semiotics, this seminar course explores visual meaning-making. It investigates how visual texts can be rhetorical and persuasive within a professional communication context. How do images dominate or become dominated by the viewer/consumer? How do images and written text combine to persuade viewers? What is visual culture? We will draw on the theories of Rudolf Arnheim, Donis Dondis, Gunther Kress and Theo van Leeuwen, amongst others. Objects of analysis will be drawn from print advertisements, organizational documents, digital media, and other multimodal texts in professional contexts. 1 Credit",

        "The Ryerson ProCom Then and Now series profiles Professional Communication alumni and asks them to reflect on their journey in the field of communication. This series asks: Where were you prior to joining Ryerson ProCom, and where are you now?",
        "As the first of a multi-part series, this instalment asks members of the Master of Professional Communication (MPC) alumni community to tell us about their professional lives since their time at Ryerson.",
        "Since its launch in 2010, the MPC program has seen tremendous growth and success. Each year, we welcome up to 25 new students, all of whom are eager to study and work in the field of communication. Some come in with clear goals and objectives to advance their careers, while others are open to new and exciting opportunities. Regardless of where their road to Ryerson started, our alumni have been charting their own paths and blazing the trail since convocation. Here are a few of their Then and Now stories.",
        "Before entering ProCom, I was working for a big bank in a minor marketing and communication role. After about a year, I discovered that the investment world didn't really light my fire, and I knew that it wouldn't be my \"forever\" job. I started to seek out opportunities to further my career and education. After discovering the Professional Communication program at Ryerson, I knew that I had to pursue a different path. Of course, this was a little bit scary, but I ultimately knew that the program would help me grow as a person and also provide me with alternate career opportunities.",
        "Currently, I am working in the healthcare sector at Can-SOLVE CKD as a Communications Coordinator. I relocated to Vancouver to join the team at the end of May 2019! (woo!) My main goal is to dive right into my new role and apply my ProCom skills! I'm really looking forward to working with a new team, in an amazing city, and working in the communication field.",
        "I think I got to where I am today by being open to life's possibilities and constantly looking for opportunities to learn more about myself and the skills that I possess. I can't say that I always expected to be doing what I'm doing, but I am happy with where I have ended up so far.",
        "I came into ProCom after working a few years on a variety of contract jobs. I wanted to deepen my knowledge in the communication field and ultimately move into more permanent work. I was also interested in moving to Toronto, since I grew up and went to college and university in Winnipeg. I remember being nervous about leaving the workforce for a brand new program. I was also nervous (and excited) about moving to a new city, but it turned out to be one of the best decisions I made for my career.",
        "I am now living in my favourite wine region in New Zealand's southern alps (near Wanaka, Central Otago), and about to start a new job as the Digital Marketing Manager for Zeffer Cider \u2013 New Zealand's largest independent craft cider company. I'm super excited to be moving into the beverage industry, and I'm also studying to become a certified sommelier.",
        "I did spend seven years climbing the corporate ladder, however. After MPC, I was with the Corporate Affairs team at Nestle. I was then promoted to an external communication specialist role, and later became the Digital Content Manager on a different team. It was a hard decision to leave the company where I worked with such an amazing team, but it was time for a new experience.",
        "Before the MPC program, I was working with a small organization in the outdoor education industry as their primary marketing and communication lead. After two years, I realized that I wanted to transition to something more significant, but I wasn\u2019t quite sure how. I stumbled on the Master of Professional Communication program at Ryerson and thought it would be the perfect way to learn new skills, while leveraging existing qualifications. At the same time, I thought it would be a way to differentiate myself from the competition. I started the program in late-2017 and graduated in late-2018!",
        "As I finished my major research paper at Ryerson, I started working at the University Health Network (UHN) as a Public Affairs Associate. Recently, however, I\u2019ve made a switch to a technology and cloud infrastructure organization called WatServ as their Communication and Marketing Specialist.",
        "Truthfully, I love this industry -- it can take you anywhere (quite literally), regardless of your interests. For these reasons, I've decided to start my own side-business (largely inspired by the MPC program), which will launch mid-2019.",
        "In the fourth year of my undergrad journalism program, I realized that as much as I loved storytelling, I didn\u2019t want to spend my career chasing hard news. Working in communication seemed as if it would allow me to be creative and tell stories, while also developing a speciality in whatever industry I found intriguing. Of course, this was all conjecture at the time, as I had no work experience in the field yet. I had a lot of questions with unknown answers.",
        "Currently, I am the Director, Growth at a boutique Toronto agency called Mayk Ideas. A few years ago, I was able to negotiate a change in my role that allowed me to work remotely, from anywhere in the world. Many of my current challenges are related to being physically out of office. From needing to ensure I\u2019m connected at all times, to taking meetings at odd hours, both my team and I have to be more flexible with each other. Those logistical elements are more than worth managing, considering how much freedom I have.",
        "I\u2019d love to say I was completely intentional with all of my career choices, but that wouldn\u2019t be true. What I\u2019ve realized looking back is that I\u2019ve consistently chosen or gone after opportunities that lead to (1) flexibility and a healthy work/life balance, (2) being given the chance to take on responsibility and leadership, and (3) working with good people.",
        "I remember back in 2011, I drove two hours to the MPC info session in a huge snowstorm to learn about the program. Back then, my main goal was to transition my career from advertising to healthcare communication.",
        "Through MPC, I met professor Gregory Levey who founded the healthtech startup, Figure 1. I was the first employee and ended up spending six years growing the company. Now, it\u2019s one of Toronto\u2019s most exciting tech companies with more than 2.5 million healthcare professional users. It wasn\u2019t the way I anticipated working in healthcare, but it ended up being way better.",
        "I learned so much from the people in my class and seeing myself as \u201cone of them\u201d pushed me to grow a lot. I look back really fondly on that year.",
        "I\u2019m now living and working in London, UK at the fintech company, Square. We help level the playing field for small businesses by allowing them to accept credit cards in person and online. I transitioned from communications to partnerships, which has allowed me to be closer to strategic business decisions (something I sometimes missed with communication).

With close to 15,000 square feet of state-of-the-art research labs, the Psychology Research and Training Centre (PRTC) was built from the ground up, and was designed to meet the specialized research needs of the department. The PRTC is within walking distance of leading research hospitals including Hospital for Sick Children, Mount Sinai Hospital, Princess Margaret Hospital, St. Michael's Hospital, Toronto General Hospital, Toronto Rehab Institute.\u00a0 Therefore, it is ideally situated for linking research and practice.",
        "In addition to wide-ranging opportunities for clinical placements in the Greater Toronto Area, our Clinical Psychology MA/PhD program partnered with the Department of Family and Community Medicine at St. Michael's Hospital to establish a Psychology Training Clinic, which provides clinical psychology students with opportunities for clinical and research training in a primary care setting, just a few doors down from the PRTC on Bond Street.\u00a0 To the best of our knowledge, ours is the only clinical training program in Canada to run its training clinic based in a primary care setting located in an academic teaching hospital.",

Because of the influence of new political developments and public administration reforms such as reinventing government and alternative service delivery (ASD) the Third Sector has taken on a greater importance in society with respect to serving the public good. New partnerships between the state and nonprofit bodies have changed the boundaries in which we have traditionally come to view the public sector.

        "PA8210 Diversity & Equity in the Public Service",
        "Diversity and equity are important features of public policy and are central to the debate about the renewal of the public service in Canada. An increasing concern with human rights, significant demographic developments, and a citizenry conscious of both the democratic deficit and the need for a representative public service workforce, call into question the values and ethos of public service in Canada. The broader public sector has an opportunity now to make up ground in the representation of historically disadvantaged groups in ways that will help to create an exemplary workplace. The imperative to renew and rejuvenate the public service is matched with the reality of a labour market that is increasingly diverse. The Charter of Rights and Freedoms, the Multiculturalism Act, the federal Human Rights Act and provincial Human Rights Codes have embedded in them a core set of rights, values and responsibilities. Part of the challenge in a democratic society like Canada is navigating between competing rights, claims and values. In this course specific emphasis is devoted to the following policy fields: immigration policy, multiculturalism, native self- government, human rights, employment equity, gender relations and language rights. 1 Credit",

        "The chief objective of this course is to enable students to acquire a deeper understanding of the processes and structures that shape the character and outcome of policy-making aimed at improving conditions of life in developing countries. The course begins by providing students with some historical and theoretical context to the emergence of international development as a field of study and practice. It then goes on to examine debates around policy-making and implementation in a number of key areas, such as environmental management, gender, education, health, poverty alleviation, agriculture, urban development, and post-conflict reconstruction and aid. 1 Credit",
        "PA8217 Ethics and Communication in Public Policy",
        "This course examines questions of values and ethics in public policy with a special focus on government communication. We will begin by studying ethical conundrums in policy making, as well as the ways in which policy is informed by value conflict. Next, we will turn to the theoretical study of successful and ethical political communication. Finally, we will study communication in practice, developing skills in day-to-day communication and in communications management and strategy. 1 Credit",
        "PA8218 Indigenous Law and Policy in Canada",
        "This course takes a critical look at the legal issues which most affect the lives of Aboriginal peoples, their communities and organizations in Canada. The challenges faced by both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal governments in addressing legal issues such as Aboriginal and Treaty rights, Aboriginal title, land claims, Aboriginal identity and self-government are often played out in the courts, federalism and the bureaucracy. Some of the legal and policy decisions in Canada have advanced the position of Aboriginal peoples in Canada, while others have hampered progress. These legal decisions also have a significant impact on federal and provincial policies in relation to Aboriginal peoples. Similarly, Aboriginal communities must address these legal issues within their own governments and organizations. The objective of this course is to engage graduate students in thinking critically about these legal issues with a view to advancing their own ideas about how to address the resulting policy implications for Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal governments in Canada. 1 Credit.",

        "AIDS2018 is the biennial global conference on science, research, advocacy and human rights related to the AIDS epidemic.\u00a0And at this year's event, currently underway in\u00a0Amsterdam, a Ryerson University alumnus is on hand to present his research to an international audience.",
        "Christian Hui, social work \u201916 and master of social work \u201917,\u00a0is disseminating the findings of his major research paper (MRP), a key component of Ryerson's graduate-level social work program. His\u00a0paper, which was supervised by Samantha Wehbi, social work professor\u00a0and associate dean of student affairs at Ryerson\u2019s Yeates School of Graduate Studies, is entitled\u00a0AIDS in Action: A New Movement Led by Canadians Living with HIV and its Implications on Critical Anti-Oppressive Social Work Practice., external link",
        "An HIV-positive activist, Hui is co-founder of the Canadian Positive People Network (CPPN), an independent organization that fights stigma and gives voice to communities affected by HIV and HIV co-infections, such as hepatitis C. Hui\u2019s research shows that Canada's response to HIV has not fully considered the changing experiences, needs and challenges of people living with HIV-AIDS (PHAs).",
        "\u201cAs both a service user and service provider, I know accessing appropriate HIV-related services for PHAs can be difficult due to systemic and structural barriers,\u201d Hui said in an interview before travelling to the Netherlands. \u201cPHAs should be the ones to inform the HIV agenda and not just be passive receivers of services.\u201d",
        "To understand how the now three-year old CPPN can thrive and best serve\u00a0its community, Hui interviewed five HIV-positive activists who represented a cross-section of Canadians. Their backgrounds differed, but they offered the same message: a renewed AIDS response must adopt a positive people-centred approach and achieve equity.",
        "\"Aside from providing care with\u00a0the human touch,\" said Hui, \"AIDS service organizations need to create safe spaces, become inclusive, and learn how to make room and support the agendas of marginalized groups such as racialized newcomers and transgender populations.\"",
        "Hui will discuss these and other findings during a poster presentation at AIDS2018.\u00a0\u201cI am looking forward to the dialogue with a global audience of PHAs, activists, researchers, scientists, academics and policy makers,\u201d he said.",
        "Earlier this week, Hui gave an oral presentation on a panel discussion about activism and equity during the fourth annual International Conference on the Social Sciences and Humanities in HIV, one of the official precursors of AIDS2018. Finally, at the Canadian Pavilion, as part of his commitment to the Truth and Reconciliation process, Hui will present his MRP as a mainstream settler researcher and engage delegates to brainstorm ways to walk alongside Indigenous people in the HIV response.",
        "While a Ryerson student, Hui received a Canadian Institutes of Health Research Frederick Banting and Charles Best Canada Graduate-Master\u2019s Scholarship and a Ryerson Graduate Development Award. Today, he is a steering member of the global Undetectable = Untransmittable campaign, and in September, will become a community investigator with the Canadian HIV Observational Cohort.",
