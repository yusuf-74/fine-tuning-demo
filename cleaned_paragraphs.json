    "If you're ever looking for researcher James Gr\u00e4fe, you would be advised to check his schedule.  Four days of the work week, Gr\u00e4fe is based at Ryerson University, where he's a professor in the Department of Physics. On the remaining day, though, he can be found at a local hospital, where as a clinical medical physicist, he ensures cancer patients receive the correct dose of radiation, precisely where it's needed to treat their disease.  \"I'm essentially a pharmacist for radiation,\" he says of his work at the Odette Cancer Centre, part of Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre. Indeed, Gr\u00e4fe's entire career is directed toward improving patient care, whether that means optimizing a course of treatment or preparing the next generation of clinical professionals.  For example, as a certified member of the Canadian College of Physicists in Medicine, Gr\u00e4fe serves as an important instructor and mentor for biomedical students in Ryerson's graduate-level Option in Medical Physics. The specialized stream, which is accredited by the Commission on Accreditation of Medical Physics Educational Programs, enables Ryerson students, if they wish, to apply to post-graduate residency programs in medical physics.  Gr\u00e4fe is constantly looking for new ways to advance students' knowledge and skills. For instance, thanks to a partnership he developed with clinical medical physicist Rao Khan at the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis (WUSM), Ryerson students have the opportunity to work with state-of-the-art radiation therapy equipment.",
    "Another example of leading-edge technology at WUSM is a proton therapy machine. The expensive piece of equipment, which isn't currently available in Canada, could potentially reduce the damage that radiation therapy inflicts on non-cancerous cells in the body for some select disease sites.  Gr\u00e4fe uses the proton technology to study the nuclear and atomic interactions that occur when a contrast agent containing the element gadolinium is introduced into the body in order to view and assess a tumor. The goal is to develop a way of tracking a tumor's position and response to radiation treatment in real time.  \"It would give us an extra degree of confidence,\u201d says Gr\u00e4fe, noting the work is an extension of his concurrent research on rare earth metals and their connection to bone health. That project has received funding from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada.  Finally, Gr\u00e4fe is working with McMaster University researchers to study gadolinium retention. More recently, the team found that some patients continued to retain the metal five years after being administered a gadolinium-based contrast agent before undergoing an MRI scan. The research will be published in the latest issue of the journal Radiology.  \"This is important as gadolinium has no known biological role and can be toxic in high quantities,\" says Gr\u00e4fe. \"These agents should be completely eliminated from the body.\"  Gr\u00e4fe\u2019s research has received additional support from Ryerson's Faculty of Science and the Department of Physics.",

    "My name is Iman Bundu. I'm a student and aspiring cultural worker. The seeds of my interest in film began in earnest, through free trials for pay-per-view movie channels. They only continued to grow when I began university and recognized film as a viable object of study, completing my undergrad in Cinema Studies and Critical Equity and Solidarity Studies at the University of Toronto.  Throughout the course of my time there, my interests were equally, if not more, informed by developments happening in the film world at large. I supplemented my education by attending talks, workshops and screenings. This led to a newfound awareness of advancements in film restoration, as previously lost or underseen works, became more widely available. The advancements intersected with newfound calls for on screen representation by marginalized groups, a necessary endeavour but one which in the mainstream, tends toward one dimensional portraits in blockbusters to satiate viewers and quiet critiques.\u00a0  Suffice to say, this has informed my own passion to illuminate film histories across the globe, to challenge ahistorical understandings of the medium as well as trouble some of the more deeply embedded myths of who connotes a pioneer. A multidisciplinary approach has always steered my academic pursuits and serves as the basis for my goals. It's a distinct honour and privilege to have been awarded this scholarship, for a program which feels uniquely attuned to my interests. It will allow me to study at renowned institutions worldwide to gain first hand experiential knowledge and open up the possibility of exploring other threads of interest I may come across in my studies.

Also, when I won the \u201cF+PPCM scholarship\u201d, I felt confident that I could plan for my future projects. Solving my financial worries as an international student, enriching my library, and completing my photo collections in line with my final project are some of the positive effects this scholarship can have on my future. This fund was given to me by the university, which proved to be a supporter to me at the beginning, and I am proud of that, and I tried that I can use this fund to be successful in my future career.",

The substantive questions and particular data sets to which these tools will be applied will be driven by student interests. While students will gain knowledge of statistical theory, special attention will be paid to the practice of carrying out analysis of complex data. For example, issues related to coding, missing data and the reporting and presentation of quantitative results will be covered. 1 Credit",
    "Toronto Metropolitan University\u2019s School of Social Work is a leader in the field of social work education through its integration and study of anti-oppression and marginalization. Anti-oppression practices draw on critical analysis of socio-economic inequalities and processes of marginalization to understand how people become users of social services. This approach to practice involves critically interpreting and reflecting on social worker-client relations. Social workers with an anti-oppression perspective aim for social justice while addressing clients\u2019 needs. This perspective is relevant to all major fields of social work, including practice within child welfare settings, hospitals, school boards, community agencies and government institutions.",
