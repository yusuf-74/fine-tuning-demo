    "In the ISRMM laboratory, cutting-edge research is conducted on the automation of two main manufacturing operations: 1) the finishing process, such as polishing and deburring, for component making, and 2) the assembly process, such as riveting and fastening, for assembly of interior and structure components. For finishing research, the laboratory is equipped with a polishing/deburring parallel robot with a hybrid toolhead, a precision deburring machine, and a three-module reconfigurable robot for belt polishing. For assembly research, the lab features a riveting/fastening robotic cell, a high-resolution 3D position measurement system (Big 3D Creator FP 70000), and a robotic motion simulator. The lab also has a testbed for aircraft wing morphing research and an aircraft cabin module for seating comfort research. ",
